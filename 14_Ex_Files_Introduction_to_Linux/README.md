# Introduction to Linux

Some concepts about Linux to get started with.

## 1. Linux Fundamentals - Some Q&A

- 01. Linux distributions are defined by the choices about configuration, software, and purpose made by the maintainer.

    - Distributions make it easy to install and use Linux without having to make all the choices and configuration settings ourselves.

- 02. Which Linux distribution should all new Linux users start with?

    - It doesn't matter, and you should choose which distribution to use based on your needs and the availability of support materials. 

- 03. If you need a desktop environment, which of these configurations would be best?

    - A virtual machine or a native installation. Both of these offer the ability to run a Linux installation with a desktop environment.

- 04. A cloud service is best-suited for running a Linux distribution which will be used through the command line.

    -  When remote command line access is needed, a cloud service can be a great choice. 

- 05. The word "Linux" most correctly refers to the Linux Kernel.

    - Linux is the name of the kernel itself, though the name often is extended to refer to any operating system built around the Linux kernel.

- 06. A desktop environment is a graphical user interface or GUI, usually featuring icons, on-screen windows, and other visual elements.

- 07. The Linux kernel:

    - allows programs to use a computer's hardware and resources;

    - lies at the heart of every Linux distribution;

    - is free and open-source.

- 08. A command line environment refers to a text-based interface where commands are typed and text is returned to the screen from programs and the shell.

- 09. The standard tools that come with most Linux distributions are small command-line programs that enable a user to work with the system.

    - Most of the tool names are short, enabling them to be typed quickly. 

- 10. Linux distributions include a set of commonly-used tools that provide a mostly consistent set of basic functionality.

    - These tools allow us to work in the same way across many distributions. 

- 11. On a Linux system, the filesystem conceptually begins with the filesystem root, represented by /.

    - The slash character represents the highest level of the filesystem, beneath which all other directories are located.

- 12. The FHS outlines what kinds of files are kept in which locations. 

- 13. On a multiuser system, which users can perform which actions on files are controlled by permissions.

    - Permissions define who can read, write, and execute files.

- 14. On a Linux system, the 'root' user is the superuser account, which is used for system administration tasks.

    - Root is used for system management and should be treated carefully.
